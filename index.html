				<p>You’re keeping your psyche in check.</p>

				<p>…pushing back against FOMO.</p>
				<p>…the fight to deviate from your trading plan.</p>
				<p>…and the ego that wants to turn $500 - $1000 into $5 million in the next
					couple of months using leverage up to your eyeballs, but your smart
					enough to know that’s a pipe dream. </p>

						<p>I’ve got to agree with the guys here. I have
							looked at other prop firms and I'm not one
							for talking bad about someone else's business...
							but by far BluFX is the leader of the pack.</p>
						<p>Others will make you go through a trial period,
							then another trial period, just in case it was
							luck (wh luck (what rubbish). I've also seen other
							firms that make you close positions for
							upcoming news releases. Which in itself
							is a bit of a joke really</p>

				<p>..trading with money you can’t afford to lose.</p>
				<p>If you’re in that situation your doomed before you even start.</p>
				<p>Before you even place a trade its already affected your mental state.</p>
				<p>Its why you pull out of your trades early only to see the market fly 100 pips in your direction</p>
				<p>Inspired by FOMO...you get in at the end of the run to only have the market
					turn on you.</p>
				<p>Not only that most traders are using small accounts, so growth is painfully
					slow.</p>
				<p>This leaves you fearful of opening trades and taking risks you shouldn't.</p>
				<p> Soon enough you find yourself loading up another account with hundreds
					or thousands of your hard-earned dollars only to see it disappear in the
					blink of an eye.</p>

					We understand how frustrating it can be to know your good at something
					but not have the resources to act on it.</p>
